# Course Flexibility Project

The purpose of this prototype is to gain an understanding of what level of flexibility is offered to students in courses, due to the lack of aggregate knowledge and dataset of syllabi. This prototype analyzes syllabi using machine learning to determine the flexibility of courses, and displays the results on a dashboard.
